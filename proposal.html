    <h1><strong>Project Proposal Dylan Haddad</strong></h1>
    <h2>Content:</h2>
    <p>My website will be a Chelsea FC fan page.</p>
    <p>
      The objective of my website will be to show inform Chelsea fans about the
      history of the club, and to attract people who are new to the sport and
      don't support any team to pick Chelsea FC as their club. This site is
      important as Football is more than just a game for fans of the beautiful
      game. Therefore, it is crucial for a club such a Chelsea FC to have a
      proper fan website where people can learn about their club while seeing
      cool stuff as well. For example: big players and why they are big players,
      goals, trophies, historic moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      My target audience would be people who are already fans of CFC or people
      who are searching for a club to support.
    </p>
    <p>
      The website will include pages such as: history of the club, big players
      and their role at CFC, historic moments, monumental goals, and the history
      of our fanbase throughout the years.
